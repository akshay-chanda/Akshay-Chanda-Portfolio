# Akshay-Chanda-Portfolio

I designed and developed a responsive portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and professional details. The goal was to create a modern and visually appealing personal brand presence that works seamlessly across all devices.

The portfolio consists of different sections including Home, About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact. With HTML, I structured the content properly; using CSS, I styled the layout with responsive design techniques; and with JavaScript, I enhanced interactivity and user experience.

By applying Flexbox, CSS Grid, and media queries, the portfolio automatically adjusts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. Interactive elements such as smooth scrolling, a responsive navigation menu, and hover animations make the website engaging. JavaScript adds features like dynamic project filtering, form validation, and content toggling, making the site more functional.

This project represents not just a showcase of my work but also my ability to build professional, responsive, and interactive websites from scratch.

Key Features:

1. HTML: Structured sections (Home, About, Skills, Projects, Contact).

2. CSS: Modern layout, Flexbox & Grid, responsive media queries, animations.

3. JavaScript: Responsive menu toggle, smooth scrolling, project filters, form validation.

4. Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

5. Professional Showcase: Serves as a personal branding tool.
